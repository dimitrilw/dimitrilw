I have an old habit of _never_ publicly sharing code, but keeping all code to private repositories,
shared among coworkers and peers. This habit comes from legacy
military training -- old habits die hard and I still get a bit edgy
when pressing "push" to anything public. It is not easy to shake something 
drilled into you over many years. Some day I will become more comfortable publishing my own public repositories
and interacting with others' public repos, too. Someday. Maybe.
