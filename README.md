I have an old habit of _never_ publicly sharing code, but keeping all code to a
close inner-circle of coworkers and peers. This habit comes from legacy
military training -- old habits die hard and I still get a bit edgy
when pressing "push" to something public. It is not easy to shake something
that was drilled into you for many years. One day at a time; just one day at a time.
