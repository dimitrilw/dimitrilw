I have an old habit of _never_ publicly sharing code, but keeping all code to a
close inner-circle of coworkers and peers. This habit comes from legacy
military training -- old habits die hard and I still get a bit edgy
when pressing "push" to something public. It is not easy to shake something
that was drilled into you for many years. One day at a time; just one day at a time.

## quick test

::: code-group

```js [js]
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

```ts [ts]
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

```py [py]
print('Hello, World!')
```

```sh [sh]
echo 'Hello, World!'
```

```go [go]
package main
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

```rust [rust]
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```
