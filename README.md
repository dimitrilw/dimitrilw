I have an old habit of _never_ publicly sharing code, but keeping all code to private repositories,
shared among coworkers and peers. This habit comes from legacy
military training -- old habits die hard and I still get a bit edgy
when pressing "push" to something public. It is not easy to shake something
that was drilled into you for many years. Some day I will become more comfortable with public repositories. Someday. Maybe.
