# Dimitri LW

I have an old habit of _never_ publicly sharing code, but keeping all code to a
close inner-circle of coworkers and peers. This habit comes from legacy
military training -- old habits die hard and I still get a bit edgy 
when pressing "push" to something public. It is not easy to shake something
that was drilled into you for many years. One day at a time; just one day at a time.

So this list serves as accountability for personal tinkering that I should
probably just share. Perhaps listing some things here will self-shame into
more consistent sharing. :blush:

    - [ ] tinker with [flume](https://github.com/zesterer/flume) for
          multi-producer, multi-consumer channels
    - [ ] make a test thing with [dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)
    - [ ] make a gRPC thing with [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic)
      - [ ] try Protobuf field-masking like
            [what Netflix does](https://bit.ly/netflix-protobuf-field-masking)
    - [ ] make a CLI using [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) (command line arg parser)
    - [ ] embed a full Python file in a Rust binary via
          [rustpython](https://rustpython.github.io/)
  - [ ] [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/)
- [ ] Python play-time:
  - [ ] [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) is written in Rust
        as a high-performance replacement for Pandas
- [ ] Go play-time:
  - [ ] do something with this
        [embedded Python interpreter](https://github.com/kluctl/go-embed-python)
- [ ] finally make a dimitrilw.github.io site
