# Dimitri LW

I have an old habit of _never_ publicly sharing code, but keeping all code to a
close inner-circle of coworkers and peers. This habit comes from legacy
military training -- old habits die hard and I still get a bit edgy
when pressing "push" to something public. It is not easy to shake something
that was drilled into you for many years. One day at a time; just one day at a time.

So this list serves as accountability for personal tinkering that I should
probably just share. Perhaps listing some things here will self-shame into
more consistent sharing. :blush:

## Recurring Activities

Daily(ish) / Weekly(ish)

- contribute to [One Life repo](https://github.com/avacore1337/OneLife)
- katas
  - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?status=NOT_STARTED)
  - [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) &
    [my Exercism repo](https://github.com/dimitrilw/exercism)
    ...note: I need to be more consistent about using this repo, not just
    the in-browser IDE that Exercism provides -- but it is just so easy when I'm
    on the go and feel like tinkering on the tablet

## The List

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
  - learn [Diesel ORM](http://diesel.rs/)
  - tinker with [flume](https://github.com/zesterer/flume) for
    multi-producer, multi-consumer channels
  - make a test thing with [dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)
  - make a gRPC thing with [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic)
    - try Protobuf field-masking like
      [what Netflix does](https://bit.ly/netflix-protobuf-field-masking)
  - make a CLI using [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) (command line arg parser)
  - embed a full Python file in a Rust binary via
    [rustpython](https://rustpython.github.io/)
  - make a data-analysis goof-off project using
    [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), which is written in Rust
    as a high-performance replacement for Pandas -- there is also a Python
    package that wraps it, so you can `pip install polars` and use it in
    Python
- [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/)
- Go (golang)
  - do something with this
    [embedded Python interpreter](https://github.com/kluctl/go-embed-python)
- finally make a dimitrilw.github.io site ...maybe make it in
  [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) instead of Hugo/Gatsby/etc,
  just to have another avenue for tinkering with Rust stuff.
  Like, I could even create a new Zola theme or something. :thinking:
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
  - get the dev-container working so I can use the repo when I am on the go
    and feel like doing a puzzle from my tablet
  - after completing a track, then begin refreshing comfort with other
    languages that I've used to some degree in the past:
    AWK, C, C++, CoffeeScript, Common Lisp, Java, JavaScript, Lua,
    Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Vim script, & Visual Basic (don't judge me)
- Clean up and publish my dotfiles
- pick one of my past private projects and make it public
  ...lot of tidying in each one, but just carve out some time,
  then pick something, and get it done --
