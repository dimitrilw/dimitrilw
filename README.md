# Dimitri LW

Public accountability for my personal projects. ...perhaps listing some things
here will self-shame into consistent progress. :blush:

- [ ] Continue growth with:
  - [ ] [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
    - [ ] learn [Diesel ORM](http://diesel.rs/)
    - [ ] tinker with [flume](https://github.com/zesterer/flume) for
          multi-producer, multi-consumer channels
    - [ ] make a test thing with [dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)
    - [ ] make a gRPC thing with [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic)
      - [ ] try Protobuf field-masking like
            [what Netflix does](https://bit.ly/netflix-protobuf-field-masking)
    - [ ] make a CLI using [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) (command line arg parser)
    - [ ] embed a full python file in a Rust binary via
          [rustpython](https://rustpython.github.io/)
  - [ ] [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/)
- [ ] Python play-time:
  - [ ] [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) is written in Rust
        as a high-performance replacement for Pandas
- [ ] Go play-time:
  - [ ] do something with this
        [embedded Python interpreter](https://github.com/kluctl/go-embed-python)
- [ ] finally make a dimitrilw.github.io site
- [ ] Clean up and publish my dotfiles
