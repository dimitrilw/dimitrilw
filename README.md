# Dimitri LW

I have an old habit of _never_ publicly sharing code, but keeping all code to a
close inner-circle of coworkers and peers. This habit comes from legacy
military training -- old habits die hard and I still get a bit edgy
when pressing "push" to something public. It is not easy to shake something
that was drilled into you for many years. One day at a time; just one day at a time.

So this list serves as accountability for personal tinkering that I should
probably just share. Perhaps listing some things here will self-shame into
more consistent sharing. :blush:

## Recurring Activities

Daily(ish) / Weekly(ish)

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) &
  [my Exercism repo](https://github.com/dimitrilw/exercism)
  ...note: I need to be more consistent about using this repo, not just
  the in-browser IDE that Exercism provides -- just so easy when I'm
  on the go and feel like tinkering on the tablet
  - [Rust exercises](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises?status=available)
  - [Go exercises](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises?status=available)
  - [Bash exercises](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash/exercises?status=available)
  - [Python exercises](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises?status=available)
  - [JavaScript exercises](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises?status=available)
- [LeetCode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?status=NOT_STARTED)

## The List

- [ ] Continue growth with:
  - [ ] [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
    - [ ] learn [Diesel ORM](http://diesel.rs/)
    - [ ] tinker with [flume](https://github.com/zesterer/flume) for
          multi-producer, multi-consumer channels
    - [ ] make a test thing with [dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)
    - [ ] make a gRPC thing with [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic)
      - [ ] try Protobuf field-masking like
            [what Netflix does](https://bit.ly/netflix-protobuf-field-masking)
    - [ ] make a CLI using [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) (command line arg parser)
    - [ ] embed a full Python file in a Rust binary via
          [rustpython](https://rustpython.github.io/)
  - [ ] [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/)
  - [ ] make a data-analysis goof-off project using
        [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), which is written in Rust
        as a high-performance replacement for Pandas -- there is also a Python
        package that wraps it, so you can `pip install polars` and use it in
        Python
- [ ] finally make a dimitrilw.github.io site
- [ ] Go play-time:
  - [ ] do something with this
        [embedded Python interpreter](https://github.com/kluctl/go-embed-python)
- [ ] [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
  - [ ] get the dev-container working so I can use the repo when I am on the go
        and feel like doing a puzzle from my tablet
  - [ ] after completing a track, then begin refreshing comfort with other
        languages that I've used to some degree in the past:
        AWK, C, C++, CoffeeScript, Common Lisp, Java, JavaScript, Lua,
        Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Vim script, & Visual Basic (don't judge me)
- [ ] Clean up and publish my dotfiles
